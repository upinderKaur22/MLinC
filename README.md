# Machine Learning in C/C++
Collection of machine learning models implemented in C/C++

In a attempt to train and execute various machine learning algorithms on embedded devices, I wrote their C/C++ implementations. 

All should compile easily on C99 GCC compiler. 

##Included Models
<ul>
<li>Linear Regression
<li>Random Forest
<li>SVM (Kernels: linear, RBF)
<li>Multi-layer Perceptron
<li>Convolutional Neural Network
</ul>

I will be testing these on Arduino Portenta and reporting their training time for a simple dataset.
